/**
 * jest.runOnlyPendingTimers
 * This function is here to handle edge case of advanceTimersByTime. Cases where executing currently scheduled
 * timers will schedule yet another timer and so on. Former function will try to recursively advance the timers
 * till all such timers are exhausted. But that will never happen and you will get dreaded `Aborting after running 100000 timers, assuming an infinite loop!` error
 *
 * runOnlyPendingTimers will only execute the currently scheduled timer but will not schedule any new timer and
 * that will serve our purpose very well.
