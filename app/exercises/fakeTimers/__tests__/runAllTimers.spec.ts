/**
 * jest.runAllTimers
 * This is simplified version of jest.advanceTimersByTime. Lets say we don't want to specify by how much
 * time to we want to move our timers, but we want to execute all the timers that are scheduled currently
 * Then this function comes handy. Instead of providing time to move forward just call this function and
 * all the timers that are scheduled will be executed.
 *
 * ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ By any chance, if code you are testing has recursive timer, that is callback of one timer starts yet another
 * timer then this function will not serve the purpose. Jest has something in store for that too but thats for next
 * chapter ðŸ˜‰.
 *
 * Basically, use this function if you want to execute all the timers that are scheduled but not if you have recursive timers
