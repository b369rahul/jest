/**
 * jest.useFakeTimers
 *
 * It is very easy to enable fakeTimers in test you just need to call jest.useFakeTimers, This is replacing
 * the original implementation of setTimeout() and other timer functions. Timers can be restored to their normal
 * behavior with jest.useRealTimers().
 *
 * Utility under test is simple, it sets up the interval of 1 second and calls the provided callback function till
 * seconds passed to the utility reaches zero. So we have passed 5 seconds and callback function to the utility.
