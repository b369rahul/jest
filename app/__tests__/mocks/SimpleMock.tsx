/**
 * jest.mock
 * jest will take over the directory structure you ask it to mock and now whenever code will refer to that
 * jest will take control and use our mocks instead of what is written there.
 *
 * Mocking a module with jest.mock() is useful when you want to isolate the unit under test and simulate
 * specific behavior or responses from its dependencies. This approach allows you to control the behavior
 * of the module and focus on testing specific scenarios without relying on the actual implementation of
 * its dependencies.
 *
 * ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ jest hoists the mock calls so we can't use anything that is not in the scope inside jest.mock.
 * For example we can't declare variable outside and use it in jest.mock because when jest will hoist the mock
 * calls that variable is still not declared.
